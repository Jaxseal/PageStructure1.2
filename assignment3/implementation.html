            <h2>security Issues</h2>
            <h1>Virus</h1>
            <p>One type of virus is a Trojan which is a peice of software which lloks legitimate
                however it will contain a virus as well. Another type is Malware which is a peice of software
                which is intented to cause damage to you computer by destroying and corrupting files. A way you can prevent This
                is by using a piece of anti-virus software which scans any files you download as well as ones already on your computer
                and it will check to see if the file contains a virus from a list of known viruses.
            </p>
            <h1>Hacking</h1>
            <p>Hacking is techniqly any unauthorised access to computer materail an
                example of hacking would be using a brute force algrothm to gain access to
                someones account. One way you can prevent hacking by prute force is with two factor authenticaton
                becasue you have to enter a one-time code which is sent to a email or phone number which means that even though
                the hacker has gotten the password they still cannot login to the account. The computer misuse act can be used
                prosecute hackers since gaining unauthorised access to computer material breaks this act.

            </p>
            <h1>Identity Theft</h1>
            <p>
                One exampel of identity theft is where someone steals your bank details
                and then procedes to buy stuff as if they where you. One way in which this can 
                be prevented is my making sure that you only enter your personal imformation onto trusted sites 
                which if it is normaly next to the URL bar it will have a padlock.
            </p>
            <h1> DPA and GDPR</h1>
            <p>both the Data protection act and the general data protection regulation
                can be used to prosecute an organisation if they fail to protect personnel imformation.
            One why an organisation can try to protect personal data is by making sure that they have a high level of security on that imformation
        this is to protect it from hackers who will try to gain access to this personal data. Another method is my making sure that they train all employees
    on how to handle confidential imformation since this will allow for employyes to understand how they should handle personal data. </p>
