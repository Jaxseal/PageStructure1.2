      <h1>Client factors which can affect a websites performance:</h1>
      <p>
        One issue is can be is the hardware of 
        the users device since there browser has to proccess
        the data for the website which means if the users computer is
        slow at proccessing imformatin the webpage will run slower.


      </p>
      <p>
        The second one is the device becasue webpages will display
        differently depending on the size of the devices screen this means that if 
        webpage is design for a desktop screen it could apear broken on a phone screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third one is the users choice of web browser this is 
        becasue they use different versions of the Javaengine which means that
        the script may run slightly differently.
      </p>
      <h1>Server factors which can affect a websites performance:</h1>
      <p>
        One issue which can effect the performance of a webpage is the format of the files
        since some file types for example JPG files tend to be bigger than PNG files since 
        PNG files are compressed more this means that it will be quicker to transfer then that 
        if the image was in the JPG format.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second issue is the capacity of the web server this is because the web server can 
        only manage a certain number of connections thsi means that if to may people are trying to 
        access the same website at one time it will put strain on the server there for making it slower.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third is the avaliable bandwidth this is the amount of data which can be uploaded and downloaded per second to the server
        if the server has a low bandwidth it means that it will take a long time for files to be downloaded.
