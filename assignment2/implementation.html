            <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
            <p>Below is an example of a Class selector which will apply that style for all the elements with that class,below is an example of the code: </p>
            <Code>
                <p>.header h1 {
                <p>    font-size: 30px;
                <p>       }
        </Code></p>
            <p>Universal Seletor will apply that style for all of the the elments on the page, below is an example of the code:</p>
            <Code>
                <p> *{
                <p>    font-size: 30px;
                <p>       }
        </Code></p>
        <p>Element Selector will change the style for all the elments with that elment name, below is an example of the code: </p>
            <Code>
                <p> h1{
                <p>    font-size: 30px;
                <p>       }
        </Code></p>
            <h2>Inline</h2>
            <h5></h5>
            
            <p>There are three ways which html can acess CSS one 
                of which is Inline which means that the CSS is written in 
                the tag of the html elment an example would be <code>&lt;h1 style="color: red; font-size: 30px;"&gt;</code>
                this will make the text of the h1 element red with a ont size of 30px.The reason
                why you would use inline css would be is you only want to apply that style to
                that specific element. Also if you where to use purley inline CSS it would be very un-efficant since
                you would have to write the style in the tag for every element which means that it would be more efficent to use embedded CSS. </p>
                <img src="inline.PNG" style="height:100px" alt=""><br>
            
            <br>
            <h2>Embedded</h2>
            
            <p>The second way which html can acces html is with embedded css
                this means that the CSS is written at the top of the HTML file
                in the head and it will be in a style tag an example of embedded css would
                be <code> .h1{color: yellow font-size: 50px;}</code> this would make every h1 element in the 
                html file yellow with a font size of 50.the reason why you would use embedded CSS
                over the other two ways is if you want to apply that effect to every h1 element in that
                file but you dont want to apply that effect to all of the files.</p>
                <img src="embedded.PNG" style="height:100px" alt=""><br>   
            <h2>External</h2>
            
            <p>The third way is external which is written in a seperate file from
                the html file then at the top of the HTML file you reference the css
                file an example of the code which does this is <code>&lt; link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" &gt;</code>
                then in the CSS file is where you write the CSS and then it will apply
                the effect to all the element across all the files it is referenced in 
                also if you use a variable in a CCS file then you have a CSS file refernced below
                the file below will inherit the variables from the file above.</p>
                <img src="External.PNG" style="height:100px" alt=""><br>  
                
                <h2>Summary
                </h2>
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have multiple sources of CSS which all have different properties for a single elment 
                the CSS which will be used it the most recent one, which is always inline then for inline and embedded
                it will use which ever one is lowest down in the file i.e. if the external file is refrenced after the embedded CSS
                it will use the styling in the extrenal CCS rather than the embedded.
            </p>
            <p>
               There are multiple reasons to use the different implementation styles of CSS
               for example if you are going to have a single webpage it would be pointless
               to use external CSS since you could just write it at the top of the html file
               and you have to load the CSS file aswell as teh HTML file.
            </p>
           
               <p>A reason why you might want to use inline CSS is if you only what to use that style
               for a singl elment another advantage of having inline CSS is that it overides
               the the ebbeded or External CSS. An example where i would use this is if i wanted to
               highlight a single paragragh of text since it will overight the main Style.

            </p>
            <p>The reason why you would use External is if you are going to have multiple webpages since
                it means that you only have to write the CSS once then you can just refrence it at the top of each one of the HTML files.
                Another good thing extrenal CSS if you need to edit in the future you only have to edit it once
                unlike embedded or inline which you would have to change it on everypage/element.
        
            </p>
            <p>You would use embedded CSS if you wanted to only apply that style to a single webpage which could be useful
                if you only have a single web page or if you only want to apply that styling to that one webpage. If that is the case 
                you will have to write the embedded CSS after you have refrenced the CSS. An example of where this might be useful is if you want
                to keep the same font as the other web pages but change the colours since you could write embedded CSS which changes colour and it will only change the colour
                and still use the font from the external file.
            </p>
