          <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
          <h5></h5> 
          <p>The box model is a model of all of the parts around a html element
            which is the content its self, the padding, the border and
            the margin. 
            <p class="content">As you can see there is a diagram of this on webpage as you can see
              the content is where the blue box is and this is where text and images will be displayed. You can change the background-color of an elemnt which will ceate a background for the content as you can see i have used this to create a white background for all of content. And for this particular element i have changed the back ground colour to grey </p>
            <p>The padding is where the green box is and this creates a clear area between the content and the border. This can be used to create a space between the border and the content.</p>
            <p class="border">The border is where the yellow box is and the border wraps aroung the padding. This can be used to create a border around the content.As you can see I havve changed the border colour of my border which is why I have a grey outline around this elment.</p>
            <p>The margin is the last layer which is the orange layer.and this goes around the border and this creates a clear space around the border. This can be used to space the elment from other elements which are on the page. </p>
