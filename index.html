    <h2>What JavaScript?</h2>
    <h5>A explantation of what JavaScript is.</h5>
    <p>JavaScript is a object adn event driven oriented programming .It is used
      to create the interactive elements of a webpage.
      The man reason you would use javascript is to allow for the user
      interactive features to a webpage an example would be that you could create
      buttons which hide and show differnet content when clicked on.
      
    </p>
    <h2>Objects and methods</h2>
    <p>
      Methods are chunks of code which can be called later on in the code
      the main purpose of methods is to allow for the programmer to write a piece of code once
      and if it is needed later in that program all they need to do is call the method rather than
      writing out the code again. 
    </p>
    <h2>Event handling</h2>
    <p>
      Event handling is when a peice of code is run once an
      action has occured and example would be changing the colour of a HTML elment
      when a button is clicked since the button being clicked is the event.
    </p>
    <h2>
      security Issues
    </h2>
    <p>
      Onesecurity issue with javascript is the fact that it can be used to create pop up adverts
      which could contain a link to a illegitimate website which means that the user could
      think that they are legitimate sites there for they could enter inf
    </p>
    <h2>Assess Methods</h2>
    <p>
      methods allow for the programmer to write lines of code in a method
      which then can be called later on this is useful when programming since if you have to
      use the same lines of cod eover and over you only have to write them once then after that you 
      hust refer to it using its name. you can also pass parameters this is where you pass variable into and from 
      the method this means that you can use that variable out side of the method.
    </p>
    <h2>Discuss how a scripting language can improve functionality</h2>
    <p>
      One way javascript can improve userbility is by allowing for
      you to add cookies to you webpage which allows for data to be saved on the users computer
      so that when they visit the website it can user that data and example of how it could be used
      is to remeber a users basket on shopping websites.It can also be used to
      determine what adds to show to the user based on what they have looked at this means
      that the adverts will be for things which there user is intrested in.
    <p>
      Another way javascript can improve functionality is with alert box since it 
      a box which pops up at the top of the browser window and the user has to close it
      this makes then see imformation this is oftern used to accept cookies from a website
